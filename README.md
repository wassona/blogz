<h3>blogz</h3>
<h4>A Sinatra based micro-blogging app</h4>
<p>blogz is a blogging app built on a Sinatra back-end and styled with Semantic UI. Users can create and edit posts and can also follow each other, though that doesn't really do much.</p>
<p>Although I built out several back-end apps before this, this was the first one I spent much time styling, and also was my first time using a front end framework. I liked the Semantic UI styling of the blog posts so much that reused them on my portfolio.</p>
